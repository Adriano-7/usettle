## Overview

**uSettle** is a app designed to put an end to the “you pay now, send me my share later” hassle. By simply scanning a receipt, the app identifies all items, lets users assign who ordered what, and helps settle debts quickly—either via MB Way or by tracking balances between friends. With support for fair splits and ongoing accounts, uSettle makes shared expenses simple, transparent, and hassle-free.

## Technologies

Our project started with designing prototypes in **Figma**, followed by an implementation using the **Flutter** framework. For the receipt recognition functionality, we integrated **Google Gemini** to process and extract data from images.
